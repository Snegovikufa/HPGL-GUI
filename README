This is GUI for High Perfomance Geostatic Library

Now program operate only Simple Kriging algorithm, but soon it will be able to 
use all of HPGL's algorithms.

HPGL stands for High Performance Geostatistics Library.

HPGL was written in C++ / Python to realize some geostatistical algorithms 
(see full list below). The algorithms are called in Python, by executing the 
corresponding commands.
